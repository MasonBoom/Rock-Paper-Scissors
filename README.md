# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the first program I have ever made using C++. Rock paper scissors is a command line game where you can play against the computer as the computer will select rock, paper, or scissors at random.

This project was built using the following:
 - C++
 - C++ libraries
   - iostream
   - cstdlib
   - ctime

To run this project on your local machine, you must have g++ installed. In the project directory, run `g++ r.cpp` in the terminal. After it compiles into an exe file, run `./a.exe` in the command line

Here is a demo of what it should look like when you run the program:
