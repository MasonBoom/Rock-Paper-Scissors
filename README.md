# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the first program I have ever made using C++. Rock paper scissors is a command line game where you can play against the computer as the computer will select rock, paper, or scissors at random.

This project was built using the following:
 - C++
   - iostream
   - cstdlib
   - ctime
 - VS Code
